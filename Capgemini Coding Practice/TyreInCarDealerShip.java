20

16

8

There are total 3 dealerships

dealerships1 contains 4 cars and 2 bikes

dealerships2 contains 4 cars and 0 bikes

dealerships3 contains 1 cars and 2 bikes

Total number of tyres in dealerships1  is (4 x 4) + (2 x 2) = 20

Total number of tyres in dealerships2 is (4 x 4) + (0 x 2) = 16

Total number of tyres in dealerships3 is (1 x 4) + (2 x 2) = 8
